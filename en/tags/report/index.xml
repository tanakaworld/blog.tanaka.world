      <description>English The second round of キク英文法 I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing on the second round of キク英文法. For each grammar, I&amp;rsquo;ve made example sentences that I would use in my daily life and repeated it. Once a native speaker checked my sentences, it seems like &amp;ldquo;grammatically correct but not natural&amp;rdquo;. I would like to correct my nuance too.
Repeat 100 times I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying 英語は100回フレーズを練習して始めて自分の言葉となる for the past few days. It is not possible to be able to use a phrase when you hear at a moview or a book, etc.</description>

      <description>English Learning I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing development and 1on1 in English at my company, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been less trouble with English. My level is B2 Upper Intermediate of CRFR by some skill tests such as EF SET and a company&amp;rsquo;s english skill test including reading, listening and speaking.
I feel I have issues on Grammar and Collocation.
Grammar I&amp;rsquo;ve started studying fundamental grammar first to correct my grammar because I sometimes make mistakes in conversation.</description>
